# Poetr  (Poetry Writer)

### Description

   Interactive application that would help users write poetry or song lyrics by automatically recommending words to build a certain rhyme, based on the last word from the previous verse(s). The tool will provide two modes for writing: one based on a fixed word the application recommends and one in which the user will have the possibility to select from a list of words â€“ eventually, already created (this list has to fit the context). The generated poems/lyrics could be also shared via blogs/social networks and stored in a cloud.
